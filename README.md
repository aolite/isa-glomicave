## ISA Ontology Model

This ontology is mainly focused on representing the metada related to the [ISA Model](https://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html#) and also, an update over the previous ontology based on previous versions of the model [ISA Ontological Model](https://github.com/ISA-tools/linkedISA-ontologies). Therefore, the ontology is mainly based on the implementation of this abstract model represented in the followng figure:

## ISA-Glomicave Ontological model

The proposed ontology not only focused on the abstract reference model but also, served as a extention to different metabolonic, gnomic and metabolites studies. Also, the ontoloy has been also linked with referent models in relation to provide observation and measurement ontology pattern. Finally, the proposed semantic model has been also linked with referent repositories for representing studies and assays: 

1. Metabolites repository
2. Array Express
3. GEO Repository

Considering the ontology structure, the built ontology model is built based on the following core module according to the ISA documentation:
